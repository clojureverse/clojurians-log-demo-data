{"source_team":"T03RZGPFR","text":"<@U8AJJDL2V> I like to start my repl from within emacs. From scratch it looks like this:\n```\nlein new figwheel demo\ncd demo\nemacs src\/demo\/core.cljs\n```\nThen, in emacs, run `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` (which is `, \"` in spacemacs; I'm not sure what it is in normal emacs). This will open a clojure repl and a clojurescript repl. Code sent from clj files goes to the clj repl, and code in cljs files gets sent to the cljs repl.\nThis simple setup has it working with the rhino js engine, but there is a way to get it to work with the browser repl too.","ts":"1518040594.000267","user":"U067Q76EP","team":"T03RZGPFR","type":"message","channel":"C053AK3F9"}
