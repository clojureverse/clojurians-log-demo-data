Basically what this service does is that it processes request from external clients and when doing so, it communicates with other services. Some request can have as much as 5 services to communicate with in order to be processed.\n\nThere are things I'd like to get advice for, since I'm new to clojure and don't have \"production grade\" experience with it.\n\nHow would you guys reuse HTTP connection? `clj-http` has a connection manager, but I'm not sure on how to use it properly, since it state that it needs to be shut down after use. Is the resource (I don't know, maybe socket or file descriptor) is forever going to be unrecycled even if the java jar process has stopped? I apologize if this sounds trivial, as my understanding of Java is pretty shallow.","ts":"1517475324.000057","unread_count":3,"reply_count":3,"user":"U84FTP06P","replies":[{"user":"U051SS2EU","ts":"1517497565.000376"},{"user":"U051SS2EU","ts":"1517497653.000702"},{"user":"U84FTP06P","ts":"1517541628.000085"}],"type":"message"},"type":"message","hidden":true,"channel":"C03S1KBA2"}
