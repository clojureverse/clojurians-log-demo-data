But it would be nice to have source maps so I don\u2019t have to work my poor tiny brain so hard to figure out where my exceptions are coming from. Currently, my `.js.map` files have source paths in them like `\"mission.html.out\\\/weathergen\\\/ui.cljs\"`. Probably because of something to do with the fairly complicated setup involved in getting an Electron app working, this is incorrect. It should instead be simply `\"ui.cljs\"`.

I think I\u2019m doing something wrong with the Boot fileset stuff, where the modified file is not getting added to the output. I.e. when I look at the resulting `.js.map` files in the `target` directory, they still have the incorrect path, even though debug output in my task shows me that they should be getting rewritten correctly.
