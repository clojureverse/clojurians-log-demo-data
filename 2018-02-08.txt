I glanced over that repository, but there are hundreds of lines of code, and the issue might easily be that you're simply calling a work group configuration that your hardware or drivers do not support, or that even do not make much sense (such was the original issue that was caused by calling kernels with work group dimensions 1x1.\n\nThe most common case of the exception you reported is when a code constructs work group whose global size is not an integer multiple of work group size. This is supported in OpenCL 2.0, but not allowed in OpenCL 1.2.\n\nI'll close _this_ issue now. Feel free to open _another_ issue about to working group sizes.

{"source_team":"T03RZGPFR","text":"We're currently doing an overhaul to our Clojure numerical libraries, particularly those wrapping other libs for performing non-linear equation solving or optimization. Most of these external libs seem to be pretty poor in terms of API, and built on algorithms written for the computing constraints of the 70s-80s. If you look at the code, a lot of it is just screwing around with trying to minimize memory usage etc. and\/or duplicating FORTRAN constructs etc. Seems like the state of the art should be better now that we have GPUs, cheap memory, etc. but I'm not having much luck finding things. Any suggestions? One thing I've considered is that given the rich computing resources we have, maybe the thing to do is just roll the basic algorithms rather than drag in large external libraries.","ts":"1518105319.000477","user":"U066LQXPZ","team":"T03RZGPFR","type":"message","channel":"C08PKSV2L"}
