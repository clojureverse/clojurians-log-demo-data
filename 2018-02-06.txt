{"source_team":"T03RZGPFR","text":"<@U064X3EF3>: thanks for the responses, the doc was very helpful. My use case was that I was playing with a simple FSM that brought an entity map through one or more workflows. At first spec seemed to lend itself well to defining the transitions in the FSM. For example, an entity with any number of votes is a valid entity, but once it gets a certain number of votes, it transitions to another state in the FSM. Unfortunately having one valid global definition for an attribute seems to place significant restrictions on defining multiple validity states for an entity. Am I missing an easier way to do this with spec, or is it just that spec is not the right tool for this job?","ts":"1517940517.000418","user":"U0HJK8682","team":"T03RZGPFR","type":"message","channel":"C1B1BB2Q3"}

Development was initially motivated by collaborative text editing and mobile computing. CRDTs have also been used in online chat systems, online gambling, and in the SoundCloud audio distribution platform.

Unfortunately you lose some of the great higher order features of the entity model, like being able to define one transition as a merge of previous transitions and some new criteria.\n\nOne final question: do you think that allowing local bindings in `keys` would break spec's entity model significantly?

It might have been a turning point.\nThere are many things to like in GraphQL. For example, the typing system, the idea of having, at last, an effective schema mechanism connecting client and server, or the view of a unified data graph you can query. Many of those ideas are not new at all, but if GraphQL is able to finally make them popular and accepted by development teams, I would be very happy.\nHowever, there&rsquo;s a main design problem with GraphQL that needs to be addressed: GraphQL is for building silos.\nThis open issue in GraphQL Github&rsquo;s repository shows the problem clearly.\nGraphQL exposes a single data tree, through a single end-point. All your data is captured in that single data space and cannot reference or be referenced from other GraphQL&nbsp; end-points in a standard way.\nOpen de-centralised systems don&rsquo;t exist in the GraphQL world in its current form (which is not a surprise taking into consideration the original authors of the technology).\nOf course, most organisations are just building their own public facing silo. Most of them have just a few clients they control directly: a JS web app, mobile apps, etc.\nIn this context GraphQL might be an attractive solution, specially because the integration between your client and the data layer is more sophisticated than what you can get with the mainstream interpretation of REST as some kind of HTTP+JSON combo.\nBut even if this is the case in your external facing API, probably in your back-end the landscape looks a lot more like a loosely coupled federation of services trying to work together. In this context, HTTP is still the best glue to tie them together in a unified data layer.\nIt should be possible to modify GraphQL to solve this issue and make the technology open:\nReplace (or map in a standard way) IDs by URIs: If I&rsquo;m going to reference some object in your data graph I need to be able to refer to it in an unique and unambiguous way. Also your identifiers and my identifiers need to coexist in the same identifier space. Relay global object IDs are half-way there.\nAdd namespaces for the types: If you are not alone in the data universe, you might not be the only one to define the &lsquo;User&rsquo; type. Even better, we might want to re-use the same &lsquo;User&rsquo; type. Extra points if the final identifier for the type is a URI and I can de-reference it to obtain the introspection query result for the type.\nAdd hyperlinks\/pointers to the language: I want to hold references to objects in this or other graphs using their IDs\/URIs.\nWith these three changes, and introducing a shared authentication scheme,&nbsp; a single GraphQL end-point could be broken into many smaller federated micro-GraphQL end-points conforming a single (real) data graph. This graph could also span multiple data sources in an organisation or across organisations. In a sentence, it could be a real alternative for HTTP and REST.\nThe flip side of all this is that the pieces and technologies to provide the same level of experience GraphQL offers to developers have been available for HTTP as W3C standards for more than a decade. From the foundational components to the latest bits and ideas to bind them together.\nIt&rsquo;s sad, but the surge in popularity of GraphQL makes it more clear our failure in the Linked Data and SemWeb communities to offer value and fix real problems for developers."}]},"type":"message","hidden":true,"channel":"C06DT2YSY","previous_message":{"text":"[message text edited or deleted]","type":"message","user":"U6LHZ8ZS5","ts":"1517953434.000023"}}
